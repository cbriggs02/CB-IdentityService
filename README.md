# CB2P-Web-App
I developed an independent React application using TypeScript to ensure type safety throughout the development process. This React client communicates with an ASP.NET Core Web API service that I built following RESTful architecture, complete with Swagger documentation. The project integrates seamlessly with a Microsoft SQL Server, serving as its underlying database.
